Cloned from https://github.com/FabianMitze/fieldClim

`fieldClim` is designed as a handy tool for calculations of various weather and micromicrometeorological parameters based on the measurements of a weather station.
It includes functions adressing the estimation of radiation properties, the calculations of latent, sensible, and turbulent heat fluxes, the calculation of soil heat fluxes 
as well as the estimation of thermal and mechanical boundary layers.
