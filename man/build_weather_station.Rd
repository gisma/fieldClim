\value{
List of class "weather_station", that contains:
\enumerate{
\item list of location properties
\item list of weather station properties
\item list of measurements, which will contain NULLs if they were not defined in the input
}
}
\description{
Creates a list of class "weather_station", that contains all data regarding the
weather station, its location and its measurements.
}
\details{
Parameters with preset NULL can be estimated using calculations. However some additional
variables need to be passed for the estimation of some parameters.
For usage examples see the examples below.

If p1 and p2 are NULL, they will be estimated using the elevation and air temperature.

If sw_in is NULL, it will be estimated using TOA radiation and average
atmospheric transmittance (see \link{rad_sw_in}).
By setting slope, sky_view and exposition, sw_in will be topographically corrected
(see \link{rad_sw_in_topo}).

If sw_out is NULL, sw_in and albedo or sw_in and surface_type need to be set (see \link{rad_sw_out}).

If lw_in is NULL, it will be estimated using the air temperature and relative humidity
(see \link{rad_lw_in}).
By setting sky_view, lw_in will be topographically corrected
(see \link{rad_lw_in_topo}).

If lw_out is NULL, t_surface needs to be set (see \link{rad_lw_out}).

If soil_flux is NULL, ts1, ts2, depth1, depth2, moisture and texture need to be set.
(see \link{soil_heat_flux} and \link{soil_thermal_cond}).

If additional parameters are desired, they can be commited:
\itemize{
\item location properties: "slope", "sky_view", "exposition", "texture" and "albedo".
\item depth of ground measurements: "depth1" and "depth2" in m.
\item additional measurements: "ts1", "ts2" and "t_surface" in °C and "moisture".
